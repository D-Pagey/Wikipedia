## Wikipedia Viewer -  A Free Code Camp project

**User Stories:**
- [x] I can search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting 
Wikipedia entries.
- [x] I can click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry.

This is another Intermediate Front End project where I learnt a lot on a variety
of topics including: API calls, creating elements in the DOM, creating tiny 
helper functions etc.

I've restyled this project to use SCSS and Flexbox instead of Bootstrap and the 
project is now also mobile responsive. I've also added an information Modal to 
show the user stories that the project was fulfilling. 

**Improvements:**
- Add Modal
- Fix the ::backdrop CSS element on the Dialog element. It works in the vanilla
JS version but not in the React version.

**Getting Started:**
 1. Run: `npm install`
 2. Run: `npm start` _(in a new terminal)_
 3. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/`
