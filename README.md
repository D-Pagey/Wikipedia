## Wikipedia Viewer -  A Free Code Camp project

**User Stories:**
- [x] I can search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting Wikipedia entries.
- [x] I can click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry.

This is another Intermediate Front End project where I learnt a lot on a variety of topics including: API calls, creating elements in the DOM, creating tiny helper functions etc.

I've restyled this project to use SCSS and Flexbox instead of Bootstrap and the project is now also mobile responsive. I've also added an information Modal to show the user stories that the project was fulfilling.
