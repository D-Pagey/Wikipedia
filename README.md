## Wikipedia Viewer -  A Free Code Camp project

**User Stories:**
1. I can search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting Wikipedia entries.
2. I can click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry.

This is another Intermediate Front End project where I learnt a lot on a variety of topics including: API calls, creating elements in the DOM, creating tiny helper functions etc. I would like to restyle it once my CSS is stronger and refactor some of my JavaScript code. For the time being, I am happy with it and ready to tackle the next project.
