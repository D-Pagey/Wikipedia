## Wikipedia Viewer -  A Free Code Camp project

This is the 3rd of the "Intermediate" projects in the old FreeCodeCamp 
curriculum. The biggest obstacle with this project was trying to understand 
Wikipedia's API docs. The big breakthrough came from someone explaining how 
parameters within a URL properly worked. 

The challenge in the React version came from learning how to create a complete
`ArticleList` component with dynamic data. The lesson being to abstract out the
creation of a single `Article` component. 

**User Stories:**
- [x] I can search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting 
Wikipedia entries.
- [x] I can click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry.

**Main Lessons Learnt:**
* Creating and removing DOM elements
* Understanding a more complex API
* Query parameters within a URL

**Getting Started:**
 1. Run: `npm install`
 2. Run: `npm start`
 3. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/`
