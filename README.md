## Wikipedia Viewer -  A Free Code Camp project

**User Stories:**
- [x] I can search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting 
Wikipedia entries.
- [x] I can click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry.

I've rewritten this Intermediate Front End project from native JavaScript to 
React using Create-React-App. 

They key lessons from this was how to create or remove DOM elements in both 
native JS and React. 

**Improvements:**
- Fix the ::backdrop CSS element on the Dialog element. It works in the vanilla
JS version but not in the React version.

**Getting Started:**
 1. Run: `npm install`
 2. Run: `npm start` _(in a new terminal)_
 3. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/`

You can see a Vanilla JS demo of this
